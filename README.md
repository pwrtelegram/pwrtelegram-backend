# Installation script for the PWRTelegram API

PWRTelegram was deprecated and superseded by [MadelineProto](https://github.com/danog/MadelineProto).  
If you want to use an HTTP API for interacting with MadelineProto, I highly recommend [TelegramApiServer](https://github.com/xtrime-ru/TelegramApiServer).

Thank you for using PWRTelegram.
